Cross-App Insights and Recommendations

Across the market, ingredient transparency tools perform best when they provide a clear summary first and allow deeper detail optionally. Routine-focused products create sustained value when users can quickly reach a personalized plan without being overwhelmed.

Recommendations for MVP Alignment

Onboarding: keep the quiz short and output a routine immediately; offer refinement later.

Clarity layer: provide a simple ingredient summary (Good / Caution / Avoid) with concise explanations.

Persona modes: Beginner (Sophie) vs Minimalist (Alex) to control routine complexity.

Trust: include a brief methodology note explaining how ingredient flags are determined and what sources are used.

Avoid fear-based language: present ingredient concerns as context-based guidance, not absolute danger.
